		<h3>Abstract</h3>

	</section>
	<section role="doc-introduction">
		<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
		<p>This application is destined for users to report various problems in their city, in order for the authorities to resolve them. The application has two types of accounts: normal user and admin. 
		The normal users can post different kinds of problems which can be marked as solved only by admins.</p>
	</section>

	<section role="overview">
		<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
		<p>Nowadays, everybody encounters different problems in the city, from wholes in the street to fallen billboards or blocked roads. The need of an application that centralizes these problems is big and the people are opened to such an aplication, given the fact that most of us are always connected to our smartphone.</p>
		<p>CityZen is a web based application where users can report different kinds of problems, and authorities can see these problems and resolve them, or comment them.</p>
	</section>
	<section role="objectives">
		<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
		<p>CitiZen's main objectives are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>provide a web based application for users to report problems;</li>
			<li>notify the authorities about the problems newly added by users;</li>
			<li>help users know if the problems still exist or got resolved;</li>
			<li>provide statistics about the problems, such as how many users encountered the same problem or how much time it took for a problem to be resolver</li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section role="usability">
		<h4 id="usability">Usability</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>The interface is user friendly and easy to use.</li>
			<li>The application is accessible on computers and mobile devices, being web responsive.</li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section role="branding">

	<section id="usecase">
		<h3>Use cases</h3>
		<p>Our research led to us developing the following use cases.</p>
		<h4 id="uregister">1. User registration</h4>
		<p>In order for a user to perform an action other than viewing posts he will have to be logged in. If he doesnt have an account, he will have to register and the application provides three methods to do this. A new user can register via facebook, google or the classic way, by completing a form with the users details.</p>
		<p>Steps that need to be performed when registering with Facebook or Google</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Click the button corresponding with the desired authentication methode, Facebook or Google.</li>
			<li>At this point he will be redirected to the authentication provider's page, where he will have to authorize our application.</li>
			<li>If the authorization is succesful he will be redirected to the main page.</li>
			<li>If the authorization is unsuccesful he will be redirected back to the registration page where an error will be displayed.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4 id="ulogin">2. Logging in</h4>
		<p>When a user desires to interact with our website in other ways than just viewing posts he will need to be logged in. This login process is different based on the user's registration method.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>On the main page click the button in the top right corner symbolizing a user.</li>
			<li>On the login page choose the method of authentication, if it is by Google or Facebook, or complete the username and password.</li>
			<li>Upon clicking the login, Facebook or Google button, if the user exists he will be logged in.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4 id="uaddpost">3.Adding a post</h4>
		<p>Besides automatically getting posts from social media, our application also provides users with the ability to create a new post on the platform</p>
		<ul>
			<li>On the main page a user clicks the "Add a post" button.</li>
			<li>He is redirected to a new page that gives him the option to add a new post containing rich media(videos, photos).</li>
			<li>The user will fill in the information he wants to share</li>
			<li>The user will click the submit button when he finished creating the post</li>
			<li>The system will save the post and add it to the queue.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4 id="uresolve">4.Marking an issue as resolved</h4>
		<p>Our application gives authorities the posibility to mark issues as resolved when they have done so.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>An admin user will click on the post that needs to be marked as resolved.</li>
			<li>On the post page he will clock the button that marks the post as resolved.</li>
			<li>The system will mark the post as resolved in the queue and display it with the according style.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4 id="ustats">5.Viewing statistics</h4>
		<p>Admin users have the ability to view statistics regarding posts, users and user activity on the website.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Admin users will click the button that symbolises statistics in the upper right corner.</li>
			<li>They will be directed to a page containing three tabs with statistics regarding posts and users.</li>
			<li>They will select the desired tab.</li>
			<li>The system will display the relevant statistics in the form of graphs and raw text.</li>
			<li>Users will then apply filters to the data.</li>
			<li>Users will export the data in their desired format for further analysis.</li>
